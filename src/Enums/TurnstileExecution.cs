/// Execution modes
/// 
/// By default, Turnstile tokens are obtained for a visitor upon the rendering of a widget (even in invisible mode).
/// However, in some scenarios, an application may want to embed Turnstile, but defer running the challenge until a
/// certain point in time. This is where execution mode can be used to control when a challenge runs and a token is
/// being generated.
/// 
/// There are two options:
/// 
/// 1. The challenge runs automatically after calling the Render() function.
/// 2. The challenge runs after the Render() function has been called, by invoking the turnstile.Execute(container: string | HTMLElement, jsParams?: RenderParameters) function separately.
///    This detaches the appearance and rendering of a widget from its execution.
/// </summary>
